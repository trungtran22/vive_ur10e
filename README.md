# vive_ur10e
## Teleoperating Ur10e with HTC Vive
- This is the python version [vive_ros](https://github.com/Machine-Jonte/vive_ros) and [moveit_vive](https://github.com/Machine-Jonte/moveit_vive). This project is inspired by Mr. Jonathan Osterberg's Master Thesis, but specifically used for UR10e. Since this is based on the unofficial python bindings for Valve's OpenVR, it is suggested to use the official API or Mr. Osterberg's version for the publisher.
