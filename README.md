# vive_ur10e
## Teleoperating UR10e with HTC Vive
- This is the python version of [vive_ros](https://github.com/Machine-Jonte/vive_ros) and [moveit_vive](https://github.com/Machine-Jonte/moveit_vive). This project is inspired by Mr. Jonathan Österberg's Master Thesis, but specifically used for UR10e. Since this is based on the unofficial python bindings of Valve's OpenVR, it is suggested to use the official OpenVR SDK or Mr. Österberg's C++ version for the publisher.

- More information about python bindings of OpenVR can be found here [link](https://github.com/cmbruns/pyopenvr)
